# Bulletin Board â€“ PHP Classifieds Project

## Overview

This project is a web-based "Bulletin Board" (classifieds portal) for schools or clubs. Users can create, browse, filter, and edit ads. The application is fully implemented in PHP and MySQL and **does not require JavaScript** for its core functions.

---

## Features

- **Create Ads:**  
  Users can create new ads with title, text, one or more categories, name, email, and phone number. Multiple categories can be selected per ad.

- **Filter Ads:**  
  Ads can be filtered by category using the sidebar.

- **Sort Ads:**  
  By default, the newest ads are displayed first.

- **Edit Ads:**  
  Each ad is fully clickable. Clicking on an ad opens an edit page where the ad can be changed.

- **Multiple Categories:**  
  Ads can be assigned to multiple categories (multi-select in the form).

- **Responsive Design:**  
  The interface works on both desktop and mobile devices.

- **No JavaScript Dependency:**  
  All functions (filtering, displaying, editing, creating) are handled server-side with PHP.

- **Secure Database Access:**  
  All database operations use prepared statements.
